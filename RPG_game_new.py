-Each New Zealander consumes approximately 31 kg of plastic packaging every single year
-Each New Zealander recycles approximately 5.58kgs of plastic packaging every single year
-Recycling a single plastic bottle can conserve enough energy to power a 60W bulb for 3 hours
-New Zealand waterways carry approximately 4,000,000 tonnes of plastic to sea
-Plastic waste leeches toxic chemicals into our waterways killing animals and putting humans at risk

Those are just some facts but I would like help you think deeper into the problem. We like to blame  people like you and
I for disposing of their plastic irresponsibly  but why does nobody talk about how manufacturers continue to use single 
use plastic packaging while being well aware of its impact. I urge you to not only dispose of plastic responsibly so
that it does not cause any more harm to the environment but also to raise your voice to spread awareness about plastic 
so other people can play their role as well.
